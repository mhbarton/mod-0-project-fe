## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
For me, it was a mix of like and uncomfortable. I worry about having the right answer and worry that even though I wasn't getting errors at times that my answers could still be wrong. I appreciated the ability to practice and make things habit and to test my notes and researching abilities. I had to remind myself at times to walk away and to make use of the POM breaks better. If I was truly stuck, sometimes walking away from the computer and the numerous tabs I had open gave me a chance to refresh and come back ready to tackle where I was stuck. I also found myself talking out loud to myself or explaining to the empty room what I was doing (the rubber duck method I think it was called); being able to say things out loud helped to hear where I was in the process. I did not move on until I had run my code with node and made sure I wasn't getting any errors. I appreciated being able to run the code to see what error codes came up and felt that I was getting better at recognizing how to fix my errors.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
The app that comes to mind is my Amazon account. I feel that developers probably use Arrays in several places including in my searches when I tell it I want prime only options of items, or my buy it again section.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An Array method is an ability to make changes to the elements in an Array; they are essentially functions that we can apply to an Array.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is to do repeated tasks based on a condition; we use a loop in conjunction with an array because loops do the same calculations on all (or some) of the elements; you do not want an infinite loop to occur because the loop will continue to run because a condition will never be met.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop lets us test the same question on several different items at once and it keeps going until the answer comes back false. A loop saves us time from having to write things out multiple times and instead things can be done faster.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
I would appreciate a more in-depth understanding of multiplying elements in a loop. I think I made it more complicated than it needed to be.
