// EXAMPLE: Write code below to assign Harry Potter's name to a variable and
// log that variable to the console:
var name = "Harry Potter";
console.log(name);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and
// log the result:
var enrolledStudents = 22 + 2;
console.log(enrolledStudents);

// YOU DO:
// Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
// log that variable to the console.
var harryQuote = 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!';
console.log(harryQuote);

// YOU DO:
// Declare three variables, named `firstName`, `isHungry` and `numberOfPets`.
  // Store the appropriate data types in each.
// log all three variables to the console.
var firstName = 'Marianne';
var isHungry = 'Not now';
var numberOfPets = 2;
console.log({firstName, isHungry, numberOfPets});

// IN WORDS:
// How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
  // Explain.
// With the variable firstName, I made it into a string.
// With the variable isHungry, I made it into a string as well.
// With the variable numberOfPets I made, I used a number data type.

// YOU DO:
// Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different
  // values (but same data type).
// log all three variables to the console.
firstName = 'M'; //change variable 'firstName'
isHungry = 'Having dinner now'; //change variable 'isHungry'
numberOfPets = 6; //change variable 'numberOfPets'
console.log({firstName, isHungry, numberOfPets});

// YOU DO:
// Using the variables below, log the total number of snacks to the console:
var healthySnacks = 6;
var junkFoodSnacks = 8;
var result = healthySnacks + junkFoodSnacks
console.log(result);
