## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I sometimes agree with the concern of being judged or seen as inexperienced. I have questions but am sometimes afraid to ask them for fear of that judgment and how I am perceived. I know the importance of asking questions, but sometimes I try to figure the answer out and wait to see if others ask something similar. I know I need to challenge myself to not be afraid of the perception and to ask my questions.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
The data types we learned about in this section are strings, numbers, and booleans. Strings are data types which deal with letters and other characters that are all connected within quotes. Numbers are data types which deal with all numbers including negative numbers and decimals which are actually referred to as floating point numbers. It is important to remember that large numbers are written without commas. Booleans are data types which deal with how a script is run. Booleans evaluate one of two values; the two values are true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log(` "Hello World!" `);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
The characters you use are two backslashes. The purpose of a code comment is to allow us to add information for other collaborators that will not be a part of the code and will be ignored by the Javascript interpreter.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a data item. A variable is like a box. It can hold the data and on the outside you put the name of what is being stored inside.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
var companyName;
var priceAmount;
var inStock;
companyName would probably hold strings. priceAmount would probably hold numbers. inStock would be booleans.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation basically means to join together. It puts together strings in JavaScript.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation? With a variety of websites that I have used, I have come across the help chat boxes. I think developers would have used concatenation in this areas when programming sites because they can join together strings of messages. Or even when an item is out of stock. The developer could set the code up to ask if the user wants to be notified if an item comes back in stock. 

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option) What other resources do you frequent? I have been using the book and searching on Google as well as reading through the Slack channel to see if others are posting. I worry about having the right answer, even though I am new to coding and this is all brand new to me; I am nervous about making sure I pass in order to be able to be a part of the May 9th cohort.
