## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- The idea of seeking help as a sign of strength and not a sign of weakness.
- The idea that growth mindset is a learning process; just because you are this today does not mean that you will be that tomorrow.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I think I demonstrate a Growth Mindset in the way I approach learning. I am open to learning and changing. I think I do not demonstrate a Growth Mindset in how I approach asking for help; I can hesitate and sometimes see it as a weakness. I am working to improve my skills in asking for help and asking questions.
3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I appreciated the opportunity to remember the directions we had previously used. I think that practicing over and over again with a new skill helps to make it habit. I also appreciated the opportunity to see if my notes and other resources were helpful to me or missing parts. There were times where I felt uncomfortable and somewhat inadequate, but I made myself branch out and search for answers as well as checking in the Slack channel to see if others had problems in the same areas. I also reached out to my instructor to let her know I was feeling a bit anxious about getting/finding the right answer.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement is a feature that executes different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false. It is based on the idea of if/then/else. An example of a daily life conditional is if I sleep through my alarm I will be late; this would answer true. One example of where a conditional may be used in a web application, is the Target Circle app when you enter your password. If you enter the correct password you can access your account.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
You add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by using else and else if statements. The program reads: if a condition comes back true then the code will execute the statement that is between the first set of curly brackets, if it does not then it will execute the statement that is between the second set of curly brackets and so on.


6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
The tools you would use are the logical operators (AND, OR). 

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I think having some practice with changing variables would be helpful. When I was reading through examples and problems, I can understand the concept but finding the variable that has changed was not always necessarily clear to me.
