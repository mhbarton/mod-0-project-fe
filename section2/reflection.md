## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
//1. The idea of seeking help as a sign of strength and not a sign of weakness.
//2. The idea that growth mindset is a learning process; just because you are this today does not mean that you will be that tomorrow.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
//I think I demonstrate a Growth Mindset in the way I approach learning. I am open to learning and changing. I think I do not demonstrate a Growth Mindset in how I approach asking for help; I can hesitate and sometimes see it as a weakness. I am working to improve my skills in asking for help and asking questions.
3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I appreciated the opportunity to remember the directions we had previously used. I think that practicing over and over again with a new skill helps to make it habit. I also appreciated the opportunity to see if my notes and other resources were helpful to me or missing parts. There were times where I felt uncomfortable and somewhat inadequate, but I made myself branch out and search for answers as well as checking in the Slack channel to see if others had problems in the same areas. I also reached out to my instructor to let her know I was feeling a bit anxious about getting/finding the right answer. 

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
